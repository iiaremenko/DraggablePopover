# DraggablePopover
A SwiftUI modifier that adds a draggable popover to any view, allowing the popover to stick to the corners of the parent view, similar to the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) behavior in iOS. The popover can be moved around the screen by dragging and snaps to the nearest corner when released.
